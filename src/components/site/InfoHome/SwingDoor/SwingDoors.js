                            door as the space needed to use them is less than say an Automatic Sliding Door and also
                            existing swing doors can be readily automated.</p>
                        <p className={"m-3"}>The downside with Automatic Swings doors is they need a lot of
                            protection devices as the sweep of the door arc when opening or closing has the
                            potential to strike a person and so the needs of protection are greater.</p>
